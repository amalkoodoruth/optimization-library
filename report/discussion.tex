\section{Discussion}
We successfully implemented all the algorithms in Python for the nonlinear optimization problems required and used them to solve constrained and unconstrained optimization problems, with very encouraging results, which could be made better with better algorithm implementation and test cases. \\
For the constrained nonlinear problems, we were not able to efficiently implement the barrier function algorithm as we continued to approach infeasible solutions full of zeros from various initial points.
